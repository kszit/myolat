Students will be enrolled in campus groups automatically as can then be seen in this portlet.   
chelp.campusPortlet07=If a lecturer hasn't created a course yet, students will see the link to this particular course grayed out.
chelp.campusPortlet02=Students will get access to their campus courses only on the following day after booking a module. Users newly registered in OLAT will also see their campus courses on the following day.
chelp.campusPortlet03=At the moment, this campus course feature is only available for lecturers and students of the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology, Science and the Faculty of Economics.
chelp.campusPortlet04=Using your UZH e-mail address, please send an e-mail to support@olat.uzh.ch in case there are no courses in the portlet «My campus courses» after having registered with OLAT or after having booked modules on the previous day. Don\u2019t forget to indicate the following information:

chelp.campusPortletSelection01=Here you can create a campus course with the same title as indicated in the university calendar. 
chelp.campusPortletSelection02=New Campus courses and the module booking system will be synchronized daily. Students will therefore be enrolled automatically in campus groups. Such campus courses can be adapted in the course editor according to your needs.
chelp.campusPortletSelection03=You can choose if you\u2019d like to use a template for your campus course (standard course) or if you\u2019d prefer to take one of your own courses as a basis. 
chelp.campusPortletSelection04=When creating a standard course this course will be published and activated immediately. Its language depends on the course\u2019s language indicated in the university catalog. The following four languages are available: German, French, Italian, and English.

chelp.campusPortletSelection12=If you want to offer a certain course for more than one semester, it is also possible to alternatively choose a campus course already existing before continuing that one. Therefore, you won\u2019t have to create a new course. Your «old» campus course will just receive the title of the current semester; its description will be adapted accordingly.
chelp.campusPortletSelection13=In addition, you as well as your students will be able to see your new campus course along with the one continued in your Home. In contrast to the options 1 and 2, students won\u2019t be enrolled automatically in such continued campus courses.
